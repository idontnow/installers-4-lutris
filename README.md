Custom .yml installer scripts for Lutris on Linux
  
Some save the boxes, some save the bits. I make sure the droid still works.

This project provides custom Lutris installer scripts for older PC games, with a focus on titles released around 1998–2002. The goal is to make installation and play on modern Linux systems as seamless as possible, without requiring (too much) manual troubleshooting.  
  
# Current Installers:

# How to Use  
  
1. Install Lutris on your Linux system.  
  
2. Download the .yml installer file for the game you want to install.  
  
3. In Lutris, click + → Install from a local install script.  
  
4. Select the .yml file.  
  
5. Follow the instructions provided by the installer.  
  
That’s it — Lutris will handle the setup.  
If any additional steps are needed, they will be mentioned in the script description.  
  
# Bonus Resources

This repository also hosts copies of [generic 32bit InstallShield setup executables](https://github.com/idontnow/installers-4-lutris/tree/main/generic_32bit_installer) (versions 3 and 5).  
These may be useful when installing games that shipped with 16-bit Windows setup executables, which cannot be executed on 64-bit Windows operating systems.  
In those cases, you can copy the CD contents to a drive and replace the original Setup.exe from the CD with one of the provided executables, allowing the setup to execute on 64-bit Windows (which still hosts some support for 32-bit software).  
  
# Why Preservation Matters  
  
Preservation isn’t just about archiving files — it’s about keeping forgotten worlds playable.  
  
From pit droids keeping Watto’s podracer business running, to Agent Cain unraveling the psychic chaos of Sanity: Aiken’s Artifact, to the cursed woods of Blair Witch Vol. I–III — these experiences deserve more than to be lost to time.  
  
To preserve games is to preserve imagination, experimentation, and the culture of an era.
