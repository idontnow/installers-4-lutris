You can add the old Blair Witch Volume trilogy of games to your Lutris library on Lutris.net:

Volume I - https://lutris.net/games/blair-witch-volume-1-rustin-parr/
Volume II - https://lutris.net/games/blair-witch-volume-2-the-legend-of-coffin-rock/
Volume III - https://lutris.net/games/blair-witch-volume-3-the-elly-kedward-tale/

The Lutris installer file will be found on this repo (TBD) for your own customization.

NOTE: install.iss is an InstallShield setup component that allows to silently install the game in the background to a default directory. I followed this guide to generate mine: https://help.kaseya.com/webhelp/en-us/5020000/index.htm?toc.htm?685.htm It is technically not required, and you may install your game with a custom one or without it at all if you wish. If you do decide to deviate, be mindful that the default game paths need to be adjusted accordingly in your Lutris settings!
